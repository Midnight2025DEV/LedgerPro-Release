### ✅ Phase 2: Rule Persistence System
**Goal**: Enable custom user rules with persistent storage  
**Achievement**: Complete CRUD system for user-defined categorization rules

#### Core Components:
- **RuleStorageService**: JSON-based persistence to Documents folder
- **Custom Rule Management**: Create, read, update, delete operations
- **System + Custom Integration**: Seamless rule combination
- **Learning System**: Rule confidence adaptation

#### Tests: 35/35 ✅
- RuleStorageServiceTests: 5 tests (Persistence operations)
- CategoryServiceCustomRuleTests: 5 tests (Enhanced with real integration)
- All previous tests maintained

### ✅ Phase 3: Import Auto-Categorization
**Goal**: Real-time categorization during file import  
**Achievement**: Seamless auto-categorization with user-friendly import summary

#### Core Components:
- **ImportCategorizationService**: Bulk transaction categorization
- **ImportResult Model**: Comprehensive categorization statistics
- **Enhanced FileUploadView**: Integrated categorization workflow
- **ImportSummaryView**: Beautiful results presentation

#### Tests: 41/41 ✅
- ImportCategorizationServiceTests: 6 tests (Import workflow)
- All previous functionality preserved and enhanced

✅ Restaurants → Food & Dining

Overall Success Rate: 42-80% (varies by transaction mix)
Conservative thresholds prevent false categorizations
```

### Real Transaction Test Results:
```
📊 Real-world test results:
   Categorized: 3/7 (42%)
   High confidence: 3
   Need review: 4

✅ Chevron Gas Station → Transportation
✅ Direct Deposit Payroll → Salary  
✅ Walmart Supercenter → Shopping
❓ Local Business #123 → Uncategorized (requires user review)
```
