## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NOTES

### Git Workflow
**ALWAYS follow [GIT_WORKFLOW.md](./GIT_WORKFLOW.md):**
1. Check existing PRs: `gh pr list`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/name`
3. Make changes and test thoroughly
4. Create PR: `gh pr create`
5. **NEVER commit directly to main**

### Quality Standards
- All new features must include tests
- Documentation must be updated for user-facing changes
- Performance must not regress
- Security must be maintained or improved

### Priority Order
Focus on current priorities before moving to future items. User experience and quality improvements take precedence over new features.
