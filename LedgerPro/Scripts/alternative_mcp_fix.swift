print("• Even with 15s initial delay + 3 retries with 5s delays = 30s total")
print("• Servers still reject ping requests")
print("• This suggests the Python servers have a deeper initialization issue")

// MARK: - Alternative Approaches
print("\n💡 Alternative Solutions:")

print("\n1. Use a Different Health Check Method:")
print("   • Instead of 'ping', try 'listTools' or another method")
print("   • Some methods might be available sooner than ping")

print("\n2. Implement Progressive Health Checks:")
print("   • Start with basic connection check")
print("   • Gradually increase to full ping health checks")
print("   • Only consider server 'healthy' after successful ping")

print("\n3. Check Python Server Implementation:")
print("   • The servers might have a bug in their ping handler")
print("   • They might require a specific initialization sequence")

print("\n4. Disable Health Checks Initially:")
print("   • Let servers run without health checks for first minute")
print("   • Start health monitoring only after servers are stable")

// MARK: - Recommended Fix
