// MARK: - Summary of Changes
print("\n✅ Changes Applied:")
print("1. Increased initial delay from 2s to 5s before starting heartbeat")
print("2. Added retry logic for initial heartbeat attempts")
print("3. Server gets 3 retry attempts with 3s delays during startup")

// MARK: - Expected Behavior
print("\n📍 Expected New Behavior:")
print("1. Server connects and sends initialize request")
print("2. Waits 5 seconds (instead of 2) before first heartbeat")
print("3. If first ping fails, retries up to 3 times with 3s delays")
print("4. Only triggers reconnection after exhausting retries")

// MARK: - Timeline Comparison
print("\n⏱️ Timeline Comparison:")
print("\nOLD BEHAVIOR:")
print("  0.0s: Connect & Initialize")
print("  0.5s: Initialize response received")
print("  2.0s: First ping sent → FAILS (too early)")
print("  2.1s: Triggers reconnection → endless cycle")

print("\nNEW BEHAVIOR:")
print("  0.0s: Connect & Initialize")
print("  0.5s: Initialize response received")
print("  5.0s: First ping sent → might fail")
print("  5.1s: Retry 1/3, wait 3s")
print("  8.1s: Second ping sent → likely succeeds")
print("  8.2s: Normal heartbeat cycle begins (every 30s)")

// MARK: - Benefits
print("\n💡 Benefits of This Fix:")
print("• Gives Python servers enough time to complete initialization")
print("• Prevents endless reconnection cycles")
print("• More robust handling of slow server startup")
print("• Better user experience - no constant reconnection messages")

// MARK: - How to Test
print("\n🔍 How to Verify the Fix:")
print("1. Build the project: swift build")
print("2. Run the app and watch console output")
print("3. Look for these positive signs:")
print("   - '⏳ Initial heartbeat attempt' messages")
print("   - Servers stay connected after startup")
print("   - No rapid reconnection cycles")
print("4. Negative signs (should NOT see):")
print("   - Constant 'Heartbeat failed' messages")
print("   - Rapid connect/disconnect cycles")
print("   - 'Received request before initialization' errors")

print("\n✅ Fix validation complete!")
