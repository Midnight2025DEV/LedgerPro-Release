# LedgerPro Category System Upgrade

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of LedgerPro's advanced category system, transforming it from a simple string-based categorization to a comprehensive hierarchical system with subcategories, smart rules, budgeting, and analytics.

## Project Goals
- **Hierarchical Categories**: Support parent/child category relationships
- **Smart Categorization**: Rule-based auto-categorization with machine learning
- **Budget Integration**: Per-category budgets with tracking and alerts
- **Advanced Analytics**: Category-based spending insights and trends
- **Split Transactions**: Support for transactions spanning multiple categories
- **Custom Categories**: User-defined categories with rich metadata
- **Performance**: Efficient Core Data integration with minimal UI impact

â””â”€â”€ Budget (Integration point)
```

### Service Layer
```
CategoryService (Primary interface)
â”œâ”€â”€ CategoryRuleEngine
â”œâ”€â”€ CategoryAnalytics
â”œâ”€â”€ CategoryMigration
â””â”€â”€ CategoryValidation
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation
- New category system alongside existing string categories
- Gradual migration of transactions to new system
- Fallback to string categories for compatibility

### Phase 2: Data Migration
- Automated migration of existing categories to new format
- User review and approval of category mappings
- Bulk operations for large transaction histories

### Phase 3: Legacy Cleanup
- Remove old category strings after verification
- Optimize database structure
- Update all UI components to use new system

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed category lookups
- Efficient hierarchy queries
- Batch operations for large datasets
- Lazy loading for category trees

### UI Performance
