# MCP Timing Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The MCP servers were stuck in an endless reconnection cycle due to ping requests being sent before the Python servers completed their initialization, resulting in:
- Error: "WARNING:root:Failed to validate request: Received request before initialization was complete"
- Constant disconnect/reconnect cycles
- Heartbeat failures triggering immediate reconnections

## Root Cause
The Python MCP servers need time after responding to the `initialize` request before they can handle other requests like `ping`. The Swift client was sending ping requests too early.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. MCPServer.swift - Increased Initial Delay
**File**: `/Sources/LedgerPro/Services/MCP/MCPServer.swift`
**Change**: Line ~86
```swift
// Changed from 2 seconds to 5 seconds
try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 5_000_000_000) // 5 seconds delay
```

### 2. MCPServer.swift - Added Retry Logic for Initial Heartbeats
**File**: `/Sources/LedgerPro/Services/MCP/MCPServer.swift`
**Change**: `startHeartbeat()` method starting at line ~177
```swift
private func startHeartbeat() {
    heartbeatTask = Task {
        var initialRetryCount = 0
        let maxInitialRetries = 3
        let initialRetryDelay: TimeInterval = 3.0
        
        while !Task.isCancelled && isConnected {
            do {
                _ = try await healthCheck()
                initialRetryCount = 0  // Reset on success
            } catch {
                // During initial startup, be more patient
                if initialRetryCount < maxInitialRetries {
                    initialRetryCount += 1
                    print("⏳ Initial heartbeat attempt \(initialRetryCount)/\(maxInitialRetries)...")
                    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(initialRetryDelay * 1_000_000_000))
                    continue
                }
                // Handle as connection failure after retries exhausted
                // ... existing error handling ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. MCPBridge.swift - Delayed Health Monitoring Start
**File**: `/Sources/LedgerPro/Services/MCP/MCPBridge.swift`
**Change**: `connectAll()` method around line ~196
```swift
// Added 10-second delay before starting health monitoring
Task {
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 10_000_000_000) // 10 seconds delay
    startHealthMonitoring()
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clean and Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jonathanhernandez/Documents/Cursor_AI/LedgerPro_Main/LedgerPro
   swift package clean
   swift build
   ```

2. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   swift run
   ```

3. **Monitor Console Output**

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ GOOD Signs:
- "⏳ Initial heartbeat attempt 1/3..." messages during startup
- Servers connect and stay connected
- No rapid reconnection cycles
- Servers remain stable after 30+ seconds

### ❌ BAD Signs (should NOT see):
- "Received request before initialization was complete" errors
- Rapid connect/disconnect messages
- Constant "Attempting to reconnect" messages
- Multiple heartbeat failures within seconds

## Timeline of Expected Events
- T+0s: App starts, servers launch
- T+0-1s: Initialize requests sent and acknowledged
- T+5s: First heartbeat attempts begin
- T+5-8s: Possible "Initial heartbeat attempt" messages (normal)
- T+10s: Bridge health monitoring starts
- T+15s+: All servers stable, no errors

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] No initialization errors in console
- [ ] All 3 servers connect successfully
- [ ] Servers stay connected for > 1 minute
- [ ] No reconnection attempts after initial startup
- [ ] Console shows clean startup sequence

## If Issues Persist
1. Check Python server logs: `mcp-servers/*/logs/`
2. Kill orphaned processes: `pkill -f 'analyzer_server|openai_service|pdf_processor'`
3. Verify Python dependencies are installed
4. Increase delays further if needed

## Scripts Created
- `/Scripts/debug_mcp_timing.swift` - Analysis of the timing issue
- `/Scripts/test_mcp_fix.swift` - Validation of the fix
- `/Scripts/monitor_mcp_fix.swift` - Monitoring guide
