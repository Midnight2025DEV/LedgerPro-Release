# 🎯 FIXED - No More Nested Directories!

## ✅ Repository Structure is Now Flat

Your friend should **delete the old copy** and re-clone:

```bash
# Delete the old nested copy
rm -rf ~/Desktop/john/LedgerPro-Release

# Clone fresh copy with fixed structure
git clone https://github.com/Midnight2025DEV/LedgerPro-Release.git
cd LedgerPro-Release

# Now you should be in the ROOT directory, not nested!
pwd
# Should show: /Users/jovanlee/Desktop/john/LedgerPro-Release
# NOT: /Users/jovanlee/Desktop/john/LedgerPro-Release/LedgerPro

# Build and run
swift build
swift run
```

## 📁 Correct Directory Structure:
```
LedgerPro-Release/          ← ROOT (work from here)
├── Package.swift           ← Main package file
├── Sources/LedgerPro/      ← Swift app code
├── Tests/LedgerProTests/   ← Unit tests
├── backend/                ← Python API server
├── mcp-servers/            ← AI processing
└── README.md               ← Documentation
```

## ❌ No More Nested Mess:
- No more `LedgerPro/LedgerPro/` directories
- No more "embedded projects"
- No more path confusion

## 🚀 Your friend should now be able to:
- `swift build` ✅
- `swift run` ✅
- `swift test` ✅

All from the ROOT directory!
